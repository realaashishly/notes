# Operating Systems

An Operating System (OS) is the main software that controls a computer’s hardware and helps other programs run smoothly. It acts as a bridge between the user and the computer.

## Purpose of an OS

The primary purpose of an OS is to <span color="#D32F2F">manage a computer’s hardware</span> and <span color="#1976D2">run applications</span> so the system works <span color="#388E3C">smoothly and efficiently</span>.

- Manages hardware like CPU, memory, and storage
- Runs and controls applications
- Manages files and data
- Provides a user interface
- Ensures system security and stability

Example: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS.

## Types of Operating Systems

The primary categories of operating systems include the following types:

### 1. Batch Operating System

- Processes jobs in <span color="#D32F2F">batches</span> with <span color="#D32F2F">no user interaction</span>.
- Good for <span color="#D32F2F">repetitive</span> and large-volume tasks.
- **Examples:** IBM OS/360, early UNIX batch systems.

---

### 2. Multiprogramming Operating System

- <span color="#1976D2">Multiple programs</span> stay in memory at the same time.
- <span color="#1976D2">CPU switches</span> between them to improve efficiency.
- **Examples:** IBM OS/2, UNIX, Linux.

---

### 3. Multitasking Operating System

- Allows users to run <span color="#388E3C">several tasks simultaneously</span>.
- <span color="#388E3C">Quickly switches</span> between active programs.
- **Examples:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android.

---

### 4. Time-Sharing Operating System

- <span color="#7B1FA2">Many users</span> share the CPU simultaneously.
- Each gets a small <span color="#7B1FA2">time slice</span> for interactive use.
- **Examples:** UNIX, Multics, server-based Linux systems.

---

### 5. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)

#### a. Hard RTOS

- Must respond within <span color="#E65100">strict, guaranteed deadlines</span>.
- Used in <span color="#E65100">critical systems</span>.
- **Examples:** VxWorks, RTLinux, QNX.

#### b. Soft RTOS

- Deadlines are important but <span color="#FB8C00">minor delays are acceptable</span>.
- **Examples:** Windows CE, PSOS, soft real-time Linux.

---

### 6. Distributed Operating System

- <span color="#00796B">Multiple computers</span> work together as a <span color="#00796B">single system</span>.
- <span color="#00796B">Resources are shared</span> across machines.
- **Examples:** LOCUS, Amoeba, Google-style cluster OS models.

---

### 7. Network Operating System (NOS)

- Manages <span color="#303F9F">network resources</span> like users, files, and security.
- Used in <span color="#303F9F">LAN/WAN</span> environments.
- **Examples:** Windows Server, UNIX, Novell NetWare.

---

### 8. Mobile Operating System

- Designed for <span color="#C2185B">smartphones and tablets</span>.
- Optimized for <span color="#C2185B">touch, sensors</span>, and app-based use.
- **Examples:** Android, iOS, HarmonyOS.

---

### 9. Cloud-Based Operating System

- Runs from <span color="#0288D1">cloud infrastructure</span> with minimal local storage.
- Apps and data <span color="#0288D1">stored online</span>.
- **Examples:** Chrome OS, Joli OS, EyeOS.

---

### 10. Embedded Operating System

- Built for devices with <span color="#5D4037">dedicated functions</span> and <span color="#5D4037">limited hardware</span>.
- Fast, compact, and reliable.
- **Examples:** Embedded Linux, VxWorks, Windows Embedded, RTOS variants.
